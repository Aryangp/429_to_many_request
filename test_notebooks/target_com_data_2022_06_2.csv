Clear, compelling, and scary.""<br/> --<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> </p><p></p> ""Glenny's obsessive interest in his subject is infections, and his colorful writing and eye for detail give [<b>McMafia</b>] the feel of a juicy tell-all.""<br/> --<i>The Washington Post</i> <p></p> ""Riveting. . . . Provides insightful sociological perspectives about why certain nations spawn especially widespread and virulent organized crime networks.""<br/> --<i>The Seattle Times</i> <p></p> ""Daring. . . . A bravura piece of globe-trotting reportage.""<br/> --<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <p></p> ""A terrifying tour of the violent underworld of globalized crime.""<br/> --<i>New York Post</i> <p></p> ""Eye-opening...Engrossing.""<br/> --<i>The Miami Herald</i> <p></p> ""A vividly recounted journey through a dozen of the world's most potent gangs, cartels and transnational mafias.""<br/> --<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <p></p> For anyone who wants to understand the 21st century, this illuminating and page-turning book is essential reading.<br/> --Emma Thompson <p></p> ""'Behind every great fortune, ' said Balzac, 'there lies a great crime.' Misha Glenny has updated this aperçu for our own time.""<br/> --Christopher Hitchens, author of <i>God is Not Great</i> <p></p> <i>""</i>A riveting and chilling journey . . . Readers yearning for a deeper understanding of the real-life, international counterparts to <i>The Sopranos</i> need look no further than Glenny's engrossing study.""<br/> --<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <p></p> ""In this well-researched and riveting account, Glenny does for crime what he did for the Balkans. He dissects the international criminal organizations that run much of the world's economy and explains how the criminal underworld has both benefited from and contributed to globalization.""<br/> --Joseph Stiglitz, author of <i>Making Globalization Work</i> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><b>  About the Author </b></p><b>MISHA GLENNY</b> is the author of <i>DarkMarket, McMafia, The Rebirth of History, The Fall of Yugoslavia </i>(which won the Overseas Press Club Award in 1993 for Best Book on Foreign Affairs) and <i>The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804-1999.</i> He was a BBC Central Europe correspondent--he covered the fall of Communism and the wars in the former Yugoslavia--and has been regularly consulted by the U.S. and European governments on major policy issues.

Readers will learn to deal with doctors who don't understand, are of little or no help, or outright dismiss their condition.

Nitrogen deficiency reduces the fertility of the soil and affects the crop production severely. Plants absorb nitrogen through their roots in the form of nitrate and ammonium ions. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis and is responsible for the activation of various enzymes. Nitrogen based fertilizers are the most important means of nitrogen management. They play an important role in the areas with prolonged wet field conditions which makes the soil nitrogen deficient. However, excess nitrogen in the soil can cause nitrogen pollution. Alternative nitrogen sources such as organic residues and biological nitrogen fixation could be used to manage nitrogen effectively and increase the crop yield while reducing the harmful effects on the environment. The various studies that are constantly contributing towards advancing technologies and evolution of this field are examined in detail.

Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas 50 years ago, various theories have swirled around what was a key event in American--and world--history. Despite the conclusions of the Warren Report--that the President had been assassinated by a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald--many people doubt that to be true. Indeed, President Nixon later admitted on tape that the report was ""a hoax committed on the American people."" John Hughes-Wilson, a former colonel in British Intelligence, set out in 2007 to go through the millions of words and thousands of pieces of evidence, to put together an intelligence jigsaw of what really happened that dreadful high noon in Dallas in 1963. The result is a dramatic exposure of what actually took place and a clear indication that, while some of the pieces of that jigsaw may be missing, the truth is emerging. While the U.S. Federal Archive still keeps a million documents relating to the case under lock and key, it is beyond reasonable doubt that Jack Kennedy was the victim of a plot to remove the President of the United States. John Hughes-Wilson highlights the facts behind why Marilyn Monroe had to be silenced, LBJ's corrupt secrets, the Kennedys' secret Cuban coup plans, how the mafia manipulated politicians and the CIA, and how the assassination was covered up. Reading this book no one can be in any doubt that JFK's death was not at the hands of a lone deranged gunman, but a deadly plot to remove a President who threatened vested interests at home and abroad.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Author </b></p></br></br><b>Colonel John Hughes-Wilson</b> served in the British Army's Intelligence Corps for 30 years and is a specialist consultant to the UN and the European Union.

For these workouts, this yellow reduced resistance cable is ideal. This cord is 40 percent lighter than the standard black cords; adding it to your workouts will give you greater opportunity to strengthen your core muscles.

The self-taught Brown has long had a cult following, and this collection comes with an intimate and heartfelt appreciation by novelist Jonathan Miles. We see Brown's early forays into genre fiction and the horror story, then develop his fictional gaze closer to home, on the people and landscapes of Lafayette County, Mississippi. And what's astonishing here is the odyssey these stories chart: Brown's self-education as a writer and the incredible artistic journey he navigated from ""Plant Growin' Problems"" to ""A Roadside Resurrection.""

Now counted among the titans of modern Southern storytellers, Brown lived a life that proclaimed the power of writing your own dream."" <br> --<i><b>Garden & Gun</b></i> <p/> ""This collection showcases the depth of Brown's work and his evolution as a Mississippi artist and writer."" <br> --<i><b>Deep South Magazine</b></i> <p/> ""There is a stark, stripped-down quality to Brown's writing. His language is blunt and sometimes coarse. It is the pitch-perfect voice for telling the indelible stories of these working-class men and women who strive to do right but who often prove to be their own worst enemies."" <br> --<i><b>Atlanta Journal Constitution​</b></i> <p/> ""A thorough testament to his loving eye for rural minutiae. The details in each story . . . could only be the work of someone who'd shared an Old Milwaukee or two with his characters . . . <i><b>Tiny Love </b></i>showcases Brown's singular, unconditional empathy for the drunk and neglectful, the depraved but helpless, the ornery yet resigned--all the dogs that don't make it across the highway."" <br> --<i><b>INDY Week</b></i> <p/> ""Threads of humor and grace run through the tales of violence, infidelities, and alcoholism, masterfully introducing an unexpected compassion. Brown excels at capturing psychological complexity with spare, humane prose in an original voice that was sadly lost to us far too soon."" <br> --<i><b>Booklist</b></i> <p/> ""[An] outstanding, capacious volume . . . Whether exploring the underbelly of love or the despair of editorial rejection, Brown's stories drip with often uncomfortable detail as he describes the crass, the ugly, and the broken in ways unique and captivating."" <br> --<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i> <p/> ""Larry Brown was a celebrated writer of the grit lit genre who wrote spare, brutal stories about hard-drinking, love-hungry barflies, Vietnam vets, hunters, bricklayers and loggers."" <br> --<i><b>Atlanta Journal Constitution</b></i> <p/> ""A career-spanning collection by a master of American realism . . . Compassionate and gritty and lyrical--a master class."" <br> --<i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i> <p/> ""When I discovered <i>Big Bad Love</i>, I went back and read everything. That man could write. He moved through life with a discerning eye and a capacity for language that I wanted. How did he do that? Story makes sense of what cannot make sense just by showing you the broken tragic heart that goes on beating. Which he did so beautifully. And with a sense of humor, Lord save us . . . I could read Larry Brown anytime, even though I know what's coming, even though I know he's going to break my heart again."" <br> --<b>Dorothy Allison, author of <i>Bastard Out of Carolina</i></b> <p/> ""Larry Brown wrote stories that captured both the beauty and the brokenness of life.

The book chronicles Cynthia's story alongside the recipes she and her family eat every day--beginning when she met her husband at law school and ate out of two battered red bowls, through the first years of her legal career in New York, to when she moved to Los Angeles to start a family. <p/>As Cynthia's life has changed, her cooking has become more diverse. She shares recipes that celebrate both the commonalities and the diversity of cultures: her mother-in-law's spicy Korean-inspired take on Hawaiian poke, a sticky sesame peanut pie that combines Chinese peanut sesame brittle with the decadence of a Southern pecan pie, and a grilled cheese topped with a crisp fried egg and fiery kimchi. And of course, she shares the basics: how to make soft, pillowy steamed buns, savory pork dumplings, and a simple fried rice that can form the base of any meal. Asian food may have a reputation for having long ingredient lists and complicated instructions, but Cynthia makes it relatable, avoiding hard-to-find ingredients or equipment, and breaking down how to bring Asian flavors home into your own kitchen. <p/>Above all, Cynthia believes that food can bring us together around the same table, no matter where we are from. The message at the heart of <i>A Common Table</i> is that the food we make and eat is rarely the product of one culture or moment, but is richly interwoven--and though some dishes might seem new or different, they are often more alike than they appear.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br><i>LA-based food blog star Cynthia Chen McTernan stuns with this accessible, and personal, story of how she blends her Chinese heritage with her Southern upbringing. . . .

The early centuries of the Abbasid era witnessed a substantial network of maritime trade--the real-life background to the Sindbad tales. In this account, we first travel east to discover a vivid human landscape, including descriptions of Chinese society and government, Hindu religious practices, and natural life from flying fish to Tibetan musk-deer and Sri Lankan gems. The juxtaposed accounts create a jigsaw picture of a world not unlike our own, a world on the road to globalization. In its ports, we find a priceless cargo of information; here are the first foreign descriptions of tea and porcelain, a panorama of unusual social practices, cannibal islands, and Indian holy men--a marvelous, mundane world, contained in the compass of a novella. <p/>In <i>Mission to the Volga</i>, we move north on a diplomatic mission from Baghdad to the upper reaches of the Volga River in what is now central Russia. This colorful documentary by Ibn Fadlan relates the trials and tribulations of an embassy of diplomats and missionaries sent by caliph al-Muqtadir to deliver political and religious instruction to the recently-converted King of the Bulghars. During eleven months of grueling travel, Ibn Fadlan records the marvels he witnesses on his journey, including an aurora borealis and the white nights of the North. Crucially, he offers a description of the Viking Rus, including their customs, clothing, tattoos, and a striking account of a ship funeral. <i>Mission to the Volga</i> is also the earliest surviving instance of sustained first-person travel narrative in Arabic--a pioneering text of peerless historical and literary value. <p/>Together, the stories in<i> Two Arabic Travel Books </i>illuminate a vibrant world of diversity during the heyday of the Abbasid empire, narrated with as much curiosity and zeal as they were perceived by their observant beholders. <p/>A bilingual Arabic-English edition.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>Both these accounts are full of fascination and wonder.

He offers biblical lessons to aid in combatting bad habits and limiting patterns so that the best version of ourselves emerges. <p/><i>Win FromWithin</i> gives practical application to the story recorded in Genesis of Jacob wrestling with the man at the River Jabbok, and through it readers will learn how to become the persons they were created to be. The persons God intended each of us to be develops as we face our inner battles. With examples from his own life as well as his ministerial counseling, Gray provides a pathway to awakening. He includes strategies for confronting the past, how we have been labeled, who people have said we are, even who we think we are, so that we can win the battle and be who God intends us to be. Jacob spent much of his life running and hiding from himself. At a certain point we, like Jacob, cannot run from our true selves anymore. We must stop and face ourselves if we are to become great. <p/><i>Win FromWithin</i> helps us conquer our inner darkness and overcome such hindrances as fear, shame and guilt.

VRR reduces or eliminates lag judder and frame tearing for more fluid and better detailed gameplay. Additionally VRR enables a gaming source (such as a console or computer) to deliver video frames as fast as it can.


48Gbps Bandwidth

AudioQuest ""48"" HDMI cables can transfer up to professional 10K Ultra-HD video. The 48Gbps bandwidth is made possible by 4 balanced audio/video pairs capable of 12Gbps each. The precision and tighter manufacturing tolerances required to produce HDMI cables that transfer up to 48Gbps bandwidth mean many of AudioQuests tried-and-true ingredients and techniques are more important than ever before.


8K/10K

AudioQuest 48Gbps HDMI cables have the bandwidth required for video with resolutions up to 10K and resolutions/refresh rates up to 8K/60 and 4K/120. All AudioQuest HDMI cables are completely backward compatible with existing 4K displays.


Long-Grain Copper Conductors (HDMI)

In AudioQuest HDMI cables Solid Long-Grain Copper Silver-Plated Copper or Perfect-Surface Silver conductors improve Noise-Dissipation and overall performance. Pearl 48 uses Long-Grain Copper for its conductors.


Level 1 Noise-Dissipation (HDMI): Direction-Controlled

This is the foundation of AudioQuests Noise-Dissipation technologies. Traditional ""100% shielding"" is not enough to guard against the increasingly prevalent effects of Wi-Fi cellular and satellite radiation. In AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize the RF Noise that damages performance by ""directing"" or draining it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Additional Noise-Dissipation techniques (Levels 2 and up) are applied as budget permits to further reduce noise.


eARC: LGC + Level-1 Noise-Dissipation

Because sound matters the eARC conductors in AudioQuest's 48-Series HDMI cables receive equal love and affection featuring the same superior metals Direction-Controlled Conductors and Noise-Dissipation technologies as the main AV data pairs. In AudioQuest eARC-Priority cables the main A/V data pairs have Cinnamon-level performance (Fores","<div class=""h-margin-v-default"" data-test=""item-details-description"">Certified ""Ultra High Speed"" by HDMI Licensing Photon 48 has the bandwidth to support all the latest HDMI-2.1 features including exciting new gaming capabilities such as 4K@120 FPS (3840x2160) gaming Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) up to 120 FPS/144Hz Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and Quick Frame Transport QFT)  all of which work to ensure smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.

Of course Photon 48 isnt only made for video games. Like all AudioQuest 48 Series HDMI cables Photon 48 handles resolutions up to 10K refresh rates up to 120Hz and offers a superior immersive audio/video experience when streaming shows concerts or movies in 2K or 4K.

The performance advantages made possible by AudioQuests superior materials and design  significantly improved sound and more consistently reliable syncing between audio/video components  are especially beneficial to those who use Xbox and PlayStation consoles as hubs for streaming music movies TV and videos.

As with all AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 control and signal conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize performance-damaging RF Noise by ""directing"" (draining) it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Signal conductors employ AudioQuests Solid Long-Grain Copper a high-purity metal that minimizes noise and ensures overall performance.


4K Gaming Up to 144Hz

Sports action movies high-performance gaming and VR benefit significantly from the clarity and focus afforded by 4K.


120FPS Gaming

Ensures smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.


8K HDR

8K delivers a super-immersive viewing experience with twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of 4K and four times as many pixels. Combined with the 60Hz refresh rate this enables smooth clear viewing of the high-speed action content often found in video games.

Of course Photon 48 isnt only made for video games. Like all AudioQuest 48 Series HDMI cables Photon 48 handles resolutions up to 10K refresh rates up to 120Hz and offers a superior immersive audio/video experience when streaming shows concerts or movies in 2K or 4K.

The performance advantages made possible by AudioQuests superior materials and design  significantly improved sound and more consistently reliable syncing between audio/video components  are especially beneficial to those who use Xbox and PlayStation consoles as hubs for streaming music movies TV and videos.

As with all AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 control and signal conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize performance-damaging RF Noise by ""directing"" (draining) it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Signal conductors employ AudioQuests Solid Long-Grain Copper a high-purity metal that minimizes noise and ensures overall performance.


4K Gaming Up to 144Hz

Sports action movies high-performance gaming and VR benefit significantly from the clarity and focus afforded by 4K.


120FPS Gaming

Ensures smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.


8K HDR

8K delivers a super-immersive viewing experience with twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of 4K and four times as many pixels. Combined with the 60Hz refresh rate this enables smooth clear viewing of the high-speed action content often found in video games. 


Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) for Smooth Gaming

VRR reduces or eliminates lag judder and frame tearing for more fluid and better detailed gameplay. Additionally VRR enables a gaming source (such as a console or computer) to deliver video frames as fast as it can.


48Gbps Bandwidth

AudioQuest ""48"" HDMI cables can transfer up to professional 10K Ultra-HD video. The 48Gbps bandwidth is made possible by 4 balanced audio/video pairs capable of 12Gbps each. The precision and tighter manufacturing tolerances required to produce HDMI cables that transfer up to 48Gbps bandwidth mean many of AudioQuests tried-and-true ingredients and techniques are more important than ever before.


8K/10K

AudioQuest 48Gbps HDMI cables have the bandwidth required for video with resolutions up to 10K and resolutions/refresh rates up to 8K/60 and 4K/120. All AudioQuest HDMI cables are completely backward compatible with existing 4K displays.


Long-Grain Copper Conductors (HDMI)

In AudioQuest HDMI cables Solid Long-Grain Copper Silver-Plated Copper or Perfect-Surface Silver conductors improve Noise-Dissipation and overall performance. Pearl 48 uses Long-Grain Copper for its conductors.


Level 1 Noise-Dissipation (HDMI): Direction-Controlled

This is the foundation of AudioQuests Noise-Dissipation technologies. Traditional ""100% shielding"" is not enough to guard against the increasingly prevalent effects of Wi-Fi cellular and satellite radiation. In AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize the RF Noise that damages performance by ""directing"" or draining it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Additional Noise-Dissipation techniques (Levels 2 and up) are applied as budget permits to further reduce noise.


eARC: LGC + Level-1 Noise-Dissipation

Because sound matters the eARC conductors in AudioQuest's 48-Series HDMI cables receive equal love and affection featuring the same superior metals Direction-Controlled Conductors and Noise-Dissipation technologies as the main AV data pairs. In AudioQuest eARC-Priority cables the main A/V data pairs have Cinnamon-level performance (Fores","<div class=""h-margin-v-default"" data-test=""item-details-description"">Certified ""Ultra High Speed"" by HDMI Licensing Photon 48 has the bandwidth to support all the latest HDMI-2.1 features including exciting new gaming capabilities such as 4K@120 FPS (3840x2160) gaming Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) up to 120 FPS/144Hz Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and Quick Frame Transport QFT)  all of which work to ensure smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.

Berger analyzes many of these famous images--dogs and fire hoses turned against peaceful black marchers in Birmingham, tear gas and clubs wielded against voting-rights marchers in Selma--and argues that because white sympathy was dependent on photographs of powerless blacks, these unforgettable pictures undermined efforts to enact--or even imagine--reforms that threatened to upend the racial balance of power.<p/><br></br><p><b>  From the Back Cover </b></p></br></br>""<i>Seeing Through Race</i> is an indispensable and highly original account of how white Americans understood and remembered the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

The Art of Polish Pottery, as we know it today, started as local folk art centuries ago in the German province of Silesia. The first known pieces of “Bunzlauer” stoneware dating back to the 16th century were crafted by hand and decorated with a folk art stamping technique using potatoes. Original designs were inspired by the peacock feather using the colors of cobalt blue, sage green and ferrous red. These designs and colors are still the inspiration for modern day patterns.Today, skilled Polish artists still individually handcraft and hand decorate each piece using small sponges to stamp each pattern and color. After the process of mixing ingredients, molding the pottery, applying the decorations and glaze, the pottery is twice fired. This process makes the pottery extremely durable, it will not crack or chip easily, and it is perfect for use in the microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer.
