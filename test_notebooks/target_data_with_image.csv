This powerful story alternates with the tale of a white schoolteacher who, embittered by the horrific state of his country, is preparing to leave. Before he can do so he must confront his own demons and personal failings.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br>In this searing and timely novel, reminiscent of the work of J.M. Coetzee and Cormac McCarthy, the devastating effects of a country's economic and moral collapse provide the backdrop for a story about individual fortitude and conscience. <p/>In an unnamed and post-apocalyptic African republic, militiamen seize a scavenger as he is digging for roots, or anything that will nourish him and keep him alive. He is traded and ransomed and ends up in the hands of another group, whose members include a pregnant woman whom he is forced to carry in a wheelbarrow on a nightmarish and seemingly endless overland journey. This story alternates with the diary entries of a white schoolteacher who, embittered by the horrific state of his country, is preparing to leave. Before he can do so, however, he must confront his own demons and personal failings. Both narrators are in danger and both are apparently helpless to control their fates. When these two plotlines brilliantly and surprisingly unite the result is electrifying, shocking, and brilliant. <p/>With sparse and heartbreaking prose Ian Holding asks vital questions about personal responsibility, choice, and truth.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>Praise for <i><b>Of Beasts and Beings</b></i> <p/>Merciless, poetic, and beautiful...

Abandoned farmhouses litter the isolated mountain valleys and shady hollows. The economy has been reduced to barter and trade. </p><p>In this craggy, unwelcoming world, the central character of <i>Scribe </i>ekes out a lonely living on the family farmstead where she was raised and where her sister met an untimely end. She lets a migrant group known as the Uninvited set up temporary camps on her land, and maintains an uneasy peace with her cagey neighbors and the local enforcer. She has learned how to make paper and ink, and she has become known for her letter-writing skills, which she exchanges for tobacco, firewood, and other scarce resources. An unusual request for a letter from a man with hidden motivations unleashes the ghosts of her troubled past and sets off a series of increasingly calamitous events that culminate in a harrowing journey to a crossroads.</p><p>Drawing on traditional folktales and the history and culture of Appalachia, Alyson Hagy has crafted a gripping, swiftly plotted novel that touches on pressing issues of our time--migration, pandemic disease, the rise of authoritarianism--and makes a compelling case for the power of stories to both show us the world and transform it.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br><p>""<i>Scribe</i>, which begins with the baying of hounds and ends with silence, reminds us on every page that humans remain the storytelling animal, and that therein might lie our salvation. . . .

Nitrogen Management in Crop Production - by  Mark Taylor (Hardcover),"<p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Book </b></p></br></br>Nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient which is considered as a mineral element. Nitrogen deficiency reduces the fertility of the soil and affects the crop production severely. Plants absorb nitrogen through their roots in the form of nitrate and ammonium ions. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis and is responsible for the activation of various enzymes. Nitrogen based fertilizers are the most important means of nitrogen management. They play an important role in the areas with prolonged wet field conditions which makes the soil nitrogen deficient. However, excess nitrogen in the soil can cause nitrogen pollution. Alternative nitrogen sources such as organic residues and biological nitrogen fixation could be used to manage nitrogen effectively and increase the crop yield while reducing the harmful effects on the environment. The various studies that are constantly contributing towards advancing technologies and evolution of this field are examined in detail. Also included herein is a detailed explanation of the various concepts and applications of nitrogen management in crop production. For all those who are interested in crop production, this book can prove to be an essential guide.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br>Nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient which is considered as a mineral element.

Blue Rose Polish Pottery Nature Soup Tureen,"12.5 cup capacity, 11.0""d x 8.0""high The Art of Polish Pottery, as we know it today, started as local folk art centuries ago in the German province of Silesia. The first known pieces of “Bunzlauer” stoneware dating back to the 16th century were crafted by hand and decorated with a folk art stamping technique using potatoes. Original designs were inspired by the peacock feather using the colors of cobalt blue, sage green and ferrous red. These designs and colors are still the inspiration for modern day patterns.Today, skilled Polish artists still individually handcraft and hand decorate each piece using small sponges to stamp each pattern and color. After the process of mixing ingredients, molding the pottery, applying the decorations and glaze, the pottery is twice fired. This process makes the pottery extremely durable, it will not crack or chip easily, and it is perfect for use in the microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer.

Jfk: An American Coup d'Etat - by  Colonel John Hughes-Wilson (Paperback),"<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><p>Ever since President John F. Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas 50 years ago, various theories have swirled around what was a key event in American--and world--history. Despite the conclusions of the Warren Report--that the President had been assassinated by a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald--many people doubt that to be true. Indeed, President Nixon later admitted on tape that the report was ""a hoax committed on the American people."" John Hughes-Wilson, a former colonel in British Intelligence, set out in 2007 to go through the millions of words and thousands of pieces of evidence, to put together an intelligence jigsaw of what really happened that dreadful high noon in Dallas in 1963. The result is a dramatic exposure of what actually took place and a clear indication that, while some of the pieces of that jigsaw may be missing, the truth is emerging. While the U.S. Federal Archive still keeps a million documents relating to the case under lock and key, it is beyond reasonable doubt that Jack Kennedy was the victim of a plot to remove the President of the United States. John Hughes-Wilson highlights the facts behind why Marilyn Monroe had to be silenced, LBJ's corrupt secrets, the Kennedys' secret Cuban coup plans, how the mafia manipulated politicians and the CIA, and how the assassination was covered up. Reading this book no one can be in any doubt that JFK's death was not at the hands of a lone deranged gunman, but a deadly plot to remove a President who threatened vested interests at home and abroad.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Author </b></p></br></br><b>Colonel John Hughes-Wilson</b> served in the British Army's Intelligence Corps for 30 years and is a specialist consultant to the UN and the European Union.

Tiny Love - by  Larry Brown (Paperback),"<p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Book </b></p></br></br>The complete collection of stories by a perceptive, deeply unsentimental, and bracing writer, now all in one volume that reveals the development of his craft over time. ""Larry Brown wrote the way the best singers sing: with honesty, grit, and the kind of raw emotion that stabs you right in the heart.

He was a singular American treasure."" --Tim McGraw</b> <p/>A career-spanning collection, <i>Tiny Love</i> brings together for the first time the stories of Larry Brown's previous collections along with those never before gathered. The self-taught Brown has long had a cult following, and this collection comes with an intimate and heartfelt appreciation by novelist Jonathan Miles. We see Brown's early forays into genre fiction and the horror story, then develop his fictional gaze closer to home, on the people and landscapes of Lafayette County, Mississippi. And what's astonishing here is the odyssey these stories chart: Brown's self-education as a writer and the incredible artistic journey he navigated from ""Plant Growin' Problems"" to ""A Roadside Resurrection.""

But Brown proves that the coarsest material can produce the most affecting art."" <br> --<i><b>Men's Journal</b></i> <p/> ""The complete collection of Brown's darkly comic short stories starring smart and salty workaday Southerners . . . Now counted among the titans of modern Southern storytellers, Brown lived a life that proclaimed the power of writing your own dream."" <br> --<i><b>Garden & Gun</b></i> <p/> ""This collection showcases the depth of Brown's work and his evolution as a Mississippi artist and writer."" <br> --<i><b>Deep South Magazine</b></i> <p/> ""There is a stark, stripped-down quality to Brown's writing. His language is blunt and sometimes coarse. It is the pitch-perfect voice for telling the indelible stories of these working-class men and women who strive to do right but who often prove to be their own worst enemies."" <br> --<i><b>Atlanta Journal Constitution​</b></i> <p/> ""A thorough testament to his loving eye for rural minutiae. The details in each story . . . could only be the work of someone who'd shared an Old Milwaukee or two with his characters . . . <i><b>Tiny Love </b></i>showcases Brown's singular, unconditional empathy for the drunk and neglectful, the depraved but helpless, the ornery yet resigned--all the dogs that don't make it across the highway."" <br> --<i><b>INDY Week</b></i> <p/> ""Threads of humor and grace run through the tales of violence, infidelities, and alcoholism, masterfully introducing an unexpected compassion. Brown excels at capturing psychological complexity with spare, humane prose in an original voice that was sadly lost to us far too soon."" <br> --<i><b>Booklist</b></i> <p/> ""[An] outstanding, capacious volume . . . Whether exploring the underbelly of love or the despair of editorial rejection, Brown's stories drip with often uncomfortable detail as he describes the crass, the ugly, and the broken in ways unique and captivating."" <br> --<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i> <p/> ""Larry Brown was a celebrated writer of the grit lit genre who wrote spare, brutal stories about hard-drinking, love-hungry barflies, Vietnam vets, hunters, bricklayers and loggers."" <br> --<i><b>Atlanta Journal Constitution</b></i> <p/> ""A career-spanning collection by a master of American realism . . . Compassionate and gritty and lyrical--a master class."" <br> --<i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i> <p/> ""When I discovered <i>Big Bad Love</i>, I went back and read everything. That man could write.

The book chronicles Cynthia's story alongside the recipes she and her family eat every day--beginning when she met her husband at law school and ate out of two battered red bowls, through the first years of her legal career in New York, to when she moved to Los Angeles to start a family. <p/>As Cynthia's life has changed, her cooking has become more diverse. She shares recipes that celebrate both the commonalities and the diversity of cultures: her mother-in-law's spicy Korean-inspired take on Hawaiian poke, a sticky sesame peanut pie that combines Chinese peanut sesame brittle with the decadence of a Southern pecan pie, and a grilled cheese topped with a crisp fried egg and fiery kimchi. And of course, she shares the basics: how to make soft, pillowy steamed buns, savory pork dumplings, and a simple fried rice that can form the base of any meal. Asian food may have a reputation for having long ingredient lists and complicated instructions, but Cynthia makes it relatable, avoiding hard-to-find ingredients or equipment, and breaking down how to bring Asian flavors home into your own kitchen. <p/>Above all, Cynthia believes that food can bring us together around the same table, no matter where we are from. The message at the heart of <i>A Common Table</i> is that the food we make and eat is rarely the product of one culture or moment, but is richly interwoven--and though some dishes might seem new or different, they are often more alike than they appear.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br><i>LA-based food blog star Cynthia Chen McTernan stuns with this accessible, and personal, story of how she blends her Chinese heritage with her Southern upbringing. . . .

Two Arabic Travel Books - (Library of Arabic Literature) by  Ab&#363 & Zayd Al-S&#299 & r&#257 & f&#299 & & A&#7717 & mad Ibn Fa&#7693 & l&#257 & n,"<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><p><i>Two Arabic Travel Books</i> combines two exceptional exemplars of Arabic travel writing, penned in the same era but chronicling wildly divergent experiences. <i>Accounts of China and India</i> is a compilation of reports and anecdotes on the lands and peoples of the Indian Ocean, from the Somali headlands to China and Korea. The early centuries of the Abbasid era witnessed a substantial network of maritime trade--the real-life background to the Sindbad tales. In this account, we first travel east to discover a vivid human landscape, including descriptions of Chinese society and government, Hindu religious practices, and natural life from flying fish to Tibetan musk-deer and Sri Lankan gems. The juxtaposed accounts create a jigsaw picture of a world not unlike our own, a world on the road to globalization. In its ports, we find a priceless cargo of information; here are the first foreign descriptions of tea and porcelain, a panorama of unusual social practices, cannibal islands, and Indian holy men--a marvelous, mundane world, contained in the compass of a novella. <p/>In <i>Mission to the Volga</i>, we move north on a diplomatic mission from Baghdad to the upper reaches of the Volga River in what is now central Russia. This colorful documentary by Ibn Fadlan relates the trials and tribulations of an embassy of diplomats and missionaries sent by caliph al-Muqtadir to deliver political and religious instruction to the recently-converted King of the Bulghars. During eleven months of grueling travel, Ibn Fadlan records the marvels he witnesses on his journey, including an aurora borealis and the white nights of the North. Crucially, he offers a description of the Viking Rus, including their customs, clothing, tattoos, and a striking account of a ship funeral. <i>Mission to the Volga</i> is also the earliest surviving instance of sustained first-person travel narrative in Arabic--a pioneering text of peerless historical and literary value. <p/>Together, the stories in<i> Two Arabic Travel Books </i>illuminate a vibrant world of diversity during the heyday of the Abbasid empire, narrated with as much curiosity and zeal as they were perceived by their observant beholders. <p/>A bilingual Arabic-English edition.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>Both these accounts are full of fascination and wonder.

He offers biblical lessons to aid in combatting bad habits and limiting patterns so that the best version of ourselves emerges. <p/><i>Win FromWithin</i> gives practical application to the story recorded in Genesis of Jacob wrestling with the man at the River Jabbok, and through it readers will learn how to become the persons they were created to be. The persons God intended each of us to be develops as we face our inner battles. With examples from his own life as well as his ministerial counseling, Gray provides a pathway to awakening. He includes strategies for confronting the past, how we have been labeled, who people have said we are, even who we think we are, so that we can win the battle and be who God intends us to be. Jacob spent much of his life running and hiding from himself. At a certain point we, like Jacob, cannot run from our true selves anymore. We must stop and face ourselves if we are to become great. <p/><i>Win FromWithin</i> helps us conquer our inner darkness and overcome such hindrances as fear, shame and guilt.

AudioQuest Photon 48 4K-8K 48Gbps HDMI Cable for Xbox - 9.84 ft. (3m),"Certified ""Ultra High Speed"" by HDMI Licensing Photon 48 has the bandwidth to support all the latest HDMI-2.1 features including exciting new gaming capabilities such as 4K@120 FPS (3840x2160) gaming Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) up to 120 FPS/144Hz Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and Quick Frame Transport QFT)  all of which work to ensure smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.

Of course Photon 48 isnt only made for video games. Like all AudioQuest 48 Series HDMI cables Photon 48 handles resolutions up to 10K refresh rates up to 120Hz and offers a superior immersive audio/video experience when streaming shows concerts or movies in 2K or 4K.

The performance advantages made possible by AudioQuests superior materials and design  significantly improved sound and more consistently reliable syncing between audio/video components  are especially beneficial to those who use Xbox and PlayStation consoles as hubs for streaming music movies TV and videos.

As with all AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 control and signal conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize performance-damaging RF Noise by ""directing"" (draining) it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Signal conductors employ AudioQuests Solid Long-Grain Copper a high-purity metal that minimizes noise and ensures overall performance.


4K Gaming Up to 144Hz

Sports action movies high-performance gaming and VR benefit significantly from the clarity and focus afforded by 4K.


120FPS Gaming

Ensures smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.


8K HDR

8K delivers a super-immersive viewing experience with twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of 4K and four times as many pixels. Combined with the 60Hz refresh rate this enables smooth clear viewing of the high-speed action content often found in video games. 


Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) for Smooth Gaming

VRR reduces or eliminates lag judder and frame tearing for more fluid and better detailed gameplay. Additionally VRR enables a gaming source (such as a console or computer) to deliver video frames as fast as it can.


48Gbps Bandwidth

AudioQuest ""48"" HDMI cables can transfer up to professional 10K Ultra-HD video. The 48Gbps bandwidth is made possible by 4 balanced audio/video pairs capable of 12Gbps each. The precision and tighter manufacturing tolerances required to produce HDMI cables that transfer up to 48Gbps bandwidth mean many of AudioQuests tried-and-true ingredients and techniques are more important than ever before.


8K/10K

AudioQuest 48Gbps HDMI cables have the bandwidth required for video with resolutions up to 10K and resolutions/refresh rates up to 8K/60 and 4K/120. All AudioQuest HDMI cables are completely backward compatible with existing 4K displays.


Long-Grain Copper Conductors (HDMI)

In AudioQuest HDMI cables Solid Long-Grain Copper Silver-Plated Copper or Perfect-Surface Silver conductors improve Noise-Dissipation and overall performance. Pearl 48 uses Long-Grain Copper for its conductors.


Level 1 Noise-Dissipation (HDMI): Direction-Controlled

This is the foundation of AudioQuests Noise-Dissipation technologies. Traditional ""100% shielding"" is not enough to guard against the increasingly prevalent effects of Wi-Fi cellular and satellite radiation. In AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize the RF Noise that damages performance by ""directing"" or draining it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Additional Noise-Dissipation techniques (Levels 2 and up) are applied as budget permits to further reduce noise.


eARC: LGC + Level-1 Noise-Dissipation

Because sound matters the eARC conductors in AudioQuest's 48-Series HDMI cables receive equal love and affection featuring the same superior metals Direction-Controlled Conductors and Noise-Dissipation technologies as the main AV data pairs.

Raised with Christ - by  Adrian Warnock (Paperback),"<p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Book </b></p></br></br><p>What impact should Jesus's resurrection have on individuals and churches?

But compared to his atoning death, Jesus's resurrection sparks relatively little discussion in the church.

Warnock takes his cue from Acts, where every recorded sermon focuses on Jesus's resurrection. He stresses that Christians who faithfully proclaim both the death and the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and live out the implications of that message in vibrant, grace-filled churches, will be enabled to reach a world that lives in death's dark shadow.</p> <p>The power of the risen Christ is active in every true Christian, transforming our lives. <em>Raised with Christ</em> will help you discover afresh the massive implications of the empty tomb.

AudioQuest Photon 48 4K-8K 48Gbps HDMI Cable for Xbox - 16.4 ft. (5m),"Certified ""Ultra High Speed"" by HDMI Licensing Photon 48 has the bandwidth to support all the latest HDMI-2.1 features including exciting new gaming capabilities such as 4K@120 FPS (3840x2160) gaming Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) up to 120 FPS/144Hz Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and Quick Frame Transport QFT)  all of which work to ensure smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.

Of course Photon 48 isnt only made for video games. Like all AudioQuest 48 Series HDMI cables Photon 48 handles resolutions up to 10K refresh rates up to 120Hz and offers a superior immersive audio/video experience when streaming shows concerts or movies in 2K or 4K.

The performance advantages made possible by AudioQuests superior materials and design  significantly improved sound and more consistently reliable syncing between audio/video components  are especially beneficial to those who use Xbox and PlayStation consoles as hubs for streaming music movies TV and videos.

As with all AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 control and signal conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize performance-damaging RF Noise by ""directing"" (draining) it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Signal conductors employ AudioQuests Solid Long-Grain Copper a high-purity metal that minimizes noise and ensures overall performance.


4K Gaming Up to 144Hz

Sports action movies high-performance gaming and VR benefit significantly from the clarity and focus afforded by 4K.


120FPS Gaming

Ensures smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.


8K HDR

8K delivers a super-immersive viewing experience with twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of 4K and four times as many pixels. Combined with the 60Hz refresh rate this enables smooth clear viewing of the high-speed action content often found in video games. 


Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) for Smooth Gaming

VRR reduces or eliminates lag judder and frame tearing for more fluid and better detailed gameplay. Additionally VRR enables a gaming source (such as a console or computer) to deliver video frames as fast as it can.


48Gbps Bandwidth

AudioQuest ""48"" HDMI cables can transfer up to professional 10K Ultra-HD video. The 48Gbps bandwidth is made possible by 4 balanced audio/video pairs capable of 12Gbps each. The precision and tighter manufacturing tolerances required to produce HDMI cables that transfer up to 48Gbps bandwidth mean many of AudioQuests tried-and-true ingredients and techniques are more important than ever before.


8K/10K

AudioQuest 48Gbps HDMI cables have the bandwidth required for video with resolutions up to 10K and resolutions/refresh rates up to 8K/60 and 4K/120. All AudioQuest HDMI cables are completely backward compatible with existing 4K displays.


Long-Grain Copper Conductors (HDMI)

In AudioQuest HDMI cables Solid Long-Grain Copper Silver-Plated Copper or Perfect-Surface Silver conductors improve Noise-Dissipation and overall performance. Pearl 48 uses Long-Grain Copper for its conductors.


Level 1 Noise-Dissipation (HDMI): Direction-Controlled

This is the foundation of AudioQuests Noise-Dissipation technologies. Traditional ""100% shielding"" is not enough to guard against the increasingly prevalent effects of Wi-Fi cellular and satellite radiation. In AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize the RF Noise that damages performance by ""directing"" or draining it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Additional Noise-Dissipation techniques (Levels 2 and up) are applied as budget permits to further reduce noise.


eARC: LGC + Level-1 Noise-Dissipation

Because sound matters the eARC conductors in AudioQuest's 48-Series HDMI cables receive equal love and affection featuring the same superior metals Direction-Controlled Conductors and Noise-Dissipation technologies as the main AV data pairs. In AudioQuest eARC-Priority cables the main A/V data pairs have Cinnamon-level performance (Fores","<div class=""h-margin-v-default"" data-test=""item-details-description"">Certified ""Ultra High Speed"" by HDMI Licensing Photon 48 has the bandwidth to support all the latest HDMI-2.1 features including exciting new gaming capabilities such as 4K@120 FPS (3840x2160) gaming Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) up to 120 FPS/144Hz Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and Quick Frame Transport QFT)  all of which work to ensure smooth lag-free uninterrupted viewing and interactivity.

Chris Killip: Skinningrove - (Hardcover),"<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><p><strong>The acclaimed documentarian's last completed book revisits his early-'80s portrait of an English fishing village</strong></p><p>Of all Chris Killip's (1946-2020) bodies of work, the photographs he made between 1982 and 1984 in the village of Skinningrove on the North-East coast of England are perhaps his most intimate and encompassing--of the community he photographed and of himself. ""Like a lot of tight-knit fishing communities, it could be hostile to strangers, especially one with a camera,"" Killip recalled, ""Skinningrove fishermen believed that the sea in front of them was their private territory, theirs alone."" <p/>Although four images from the series were included in his groundbreaking <i>In Flagrante</i> (1988), Killip resisted collecting all in a single book for over three decades--he had become so invested in them and respectful of his subjects that he needed time and distance to understand their significance. For a photographer whose work was grounded in the urgent value of documenting ""ordinary"" peoples' lives, these nuanced images--radiating a vast stillness of light and time, embedded with the granularity of lives lived--reveal Killip's conviction that no life is ordinary: everyday lives are sublime. <p/>First published in 2018 as a newspaper which he personally and anonymously put into every letterbox in the village, this new Steidl edition includes an introduction by the photographer and previously unpublished photos; it was completed shortly before Killip died in October 2020.</p>","<div class=""h-margin-v-default"" data-test=""item-details-description""><p></p><br/><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p><p><strong>The acclaimed documentarian's last completed book revisits his early-'80s portrait of an English fishing village</strong></p><p>Of all Chris Killip's (1946-2020) bodies of work, the photographs he made between 1982 and 1984 in the village of Skinningrove on the North-East coast of England are perhaps his most intimate and encompassing--of the community he photographed and of himself.

Seeing Through Race - by  Martin A Berger (Paperback),"<p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Book </b></p></br></br>""George Gund Foundation imprint in African American studies""--p. [1].<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><i>Seeing through Race</i> is a boldly original reinterpretation of the iconic photographs of the black civil rights struggle. Martin A. Berger's provocative and groundbreaking study shows how the very pictures credited with arousing white sympathy, and thereby paving the way for civil rights legislation, actually limited the scope of racial reform in the 1960s. Berger analyzes many of these famous images--dogs and fire hoses turned against peaceful black marchers in Birmingham, tear gas and clubs wielded against voting-rights marchers in Selma--and argues that because white sympathy was dependent on photographs of powerless blacks, these unforgettable pictures undermined efforts to enact--or even imagine--reforms that threatened to upend the racial balance of power.<p/><br></br><p><b>  From the Back Cover </b></p></br></br>""<i>Seeing Through Race</i> is an indispensable and highly original account of how white Americans understood and remembered the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

[1].<p></p><br/><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p><i>Seeing through Race</i> is a boldly original reinterpretation of the iconic photographs of the black civil rights struggle. Martin A. Berger's provocative and groundbreaking study shows how the very pictures credited with arousing white sympathy, and thereby paving the way for civil rights legislation, actually limited the scope of racial reform in the 1960s. Berger analyzes many of these famous images--dogs and fire hoses turned against peaceful black marchers in Birmingham, tear gas and clubs wielded against voting-rights marchers in Selma--and argues that because white sympathy was dependent on photographs of powerless blacks, these unforgettable pictures undermined efforts to enact--or even imagine--reforms that threatened to upend the racial balance of power.<p></p><br/><p><b>  From the Back Cover </b></p>""<i>Seeing Through Race</i> is an indispensable and highly original account of how white Americans understood and remembered the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

Blue Rose Polish Pottery Butterfly Deep Bowl with Handles,"12.5"" diameter x 4.5"" high - great for pasta dishes or large salads! The Art of Polish Pottery, as we know it today, started as local folk art centuries ago in the German province of Silesia. The first known pieces of “Bunzlauer” stoneware dating back to the 16th century were crafted by hand and decorated with a folk art stamping technique using potatoes. Original designs were inspired by the peacock feather using the colors of cobalt blue, sage green and ferrous red. These designs and colors are still the inspiration for modern day patterns.Today, skilled Polish artists still individually handcraft and hand decorate each piece using small sponges to stamp each pattern and color. After the process of mixing ingredients, molding the pottery, applying the decorations and glaze, the pottery is twice fired. This process makes the pottery extremely durable, it will not crack or chip easily, and it is perfect for use in the microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer. Along with our pottery, we have sourced a range of absolutely beautiful hand blown glassware from Poland. It is the perfect addition to your Polish Pottery Collection!","<div class=""h-margin-v-default"" data-test=""item-details-description"">12.5"" diameter x 4.5"" high - great for pasta dishes or large salads!
